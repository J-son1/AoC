# Advent of Code 2022

This was my first attempt at AoC. My only aim was to see how far in I could get. As I progressed I tried to improve code quality by refactoring and using TDD.

## How to run

- Have `node` installed.
- In the terminal `cd` into the '2022' directory.
- Then run:
```
node app.js
```

#### Commands
- `all` - to see the answers to all completed challenges
- _number_ - to filter answers by day
- `x` - to close the app
- `help` - to view a list of commands
